# Program Schema Catalog

This catalog defines reusable program-schema names for Trace task contracts.
It is guidance for writing and reviewing objective contracts; it is not a task
inventory and does not merge public tasks by itself.

Use this document with `docs/contracts/TASK_UNIT_POLICY.md`.

## Core Rule

A program schema describes the concrete reasoning skeleton:

```text
candidate set -> filters / operands -> intermediate computation -> final operator -> output binding
```

Two tasks may share a program-schema name and still remain separate public tasks
when their scene contract, answer schema, annotation schema, prompt scaffold, or
visual witness roles differ.

Do not use a generic placeholder such as `compute(value)` or
`count(predicate)`. Pick the narrowest reusable schema that names the actual
operation.

## Count Schemas

| Schema | Use For | Do Not Merge With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `count.direct_cardinality` | Count all visible units selected by one role or narrow predicate. | Attribute binding, scoped counts, relation counts, path/search counts, counterfactual counts. |

| `count.multi_attribute_and` | Count units satisfying multiple attribute predicates conjunctively. | Single-axis membership, OR/XOR/exclusion/complement variants. |
| `count.multi_attribute_or` | Count units satisfying inclusive OR across attributes or predicates. | Single-axis set membership or arithmetic sums of separate counts. |
| `count.multi_attribute_xor` | Count units satisfying exactly one of multiple predicates. | Inclusive OR, exclusion, complement. |
| `count.multi_attribute_exclusion` | Count units satisfying one predicate while excluding another. | AND, OR, XOR, complement. |

## Analysis-Level Reasoning Operations

Every active public task class declares one or more reasoning-operation
families in a literal `reasoning_operations` tuple. That executable declaration
is authoritative. Each task doc mirrors it in a machine-readable
`## Reasoning Operations` section. These families summarize the meaningful
operations that determine the answer. They support coverage analysis and paper
figures; they are not public taxonomy nodes, task ids, query ids, or sampling
units.

Use only these keys, in this order:

| Key | Include When |
| --- | --- |
| `direct_retrieval` | The answer is obtained by a terminal localized lookup or readout, with no symbolic decoding, transformation, or other meaningful operation. This is an exclusive fallback and cannot be combined with another family. |
| `filtering` | The program constructs an answer-determining subset using a predicate, relation, or named scope. Do not add it for ordinary candidate access before ranking, matching, or arithmetic. |
| `counting` | The program returns or materially uses the cardinality of a set, sequence, path, component, or group. |
| `comparison` | The program evaluates equality, scalar order, a threshold, an interval, or another answer-determining comparison relation. |
| `ranking` | The program orders candidates by a metric or sequence position, or selects an extremum, rank, nearest, farthest, earliest, or latest candidate. A field or card named "rank" and generic MCQ choice do not qualify. |
| `aggregation` | The program reduces a peer collection using sum, mean, median, cumulative total, share, mass, or an equivalent aggregate. Fixed-arity theorem arithmetic belongs to `formula_evaluation`, not aggregation. |
| `logical_composition` | The program combines predicates or sets using AND, OR, XOR, NOT, exclusion, union, intersection, or difference. |
| `spatial_relations` | The program infers or tests a geometric, positional, directional, overlap, containment, occlusion, or metric-spatial relation. Merely reading labeled dimensions is not spatial reasoning; path/link connectivity belongs to `topology`, and projection/folding belongs to `transformation`. |
| `topology` | Connectivity, paths, components, cycles, trees, graph traversal, reachability, or another topological relation materially determines the answer. |
| `transformation` | The program applies or infers a geometric, symbolic-decoding, representational, folding, projection, overlay, or reconstruction transform. |
| `state_update` | The program simulates, applies, or reasons over a move, action, counterfactual edit, or discrete state transition. |
| `formula_evaluation` | Arithmetic, algebra, a domain formula, a derived metric, or a numeric difference/ratio/rate materially determines the answer. |
| `matching` | The program tests substantive equivalence, correspondence, consistency, completion, rule satisfaction, or candidate-to-reference matching. Merely binding a computed result to an MCQ letter is not matching. |

Assignments are multi-label when the answer genuinely requires multiple
operations. For example, a thresholded count uses `filtering`, `counting`, and
`comparison`; a conjunctive attribute count additionally uses
`logical_composition`; selecting the category with the largest sum uses
`ranking` and `aggregation`. Do not label primitive visual access, answer
serialization, annotation construction, or MCQ letter binding as reasoning
operations.

The canonical source and task-doc forms are:

```python
reasoning_operations = ("filtering", "counting", "comparison")
```

```markdown
## Reasoning Operations

Families: `filtering`, `counting`, `comparison`
```

The order must follow the table above. `direct_retrieval` must appear alone.
Assignments must be reviewed against the complete Program Contract, including
all internal query branches; filename keywords are not sufficient.

Run `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/audit_task_reasoning_operations.py` to verify
the source declarations and mirrors. During a code-first review, use
`--allow-doc-drift`; after review, use `--sync-docs` and rerun without that
exception. Do not manually maintain an independent operation mapping.

## Review Guidance

When reviewing a task contract:

1. Start with the concrete task behavior, not the old task name.
2. Pick the most specific reusable schema above.
3. Add a new schema only when none of the existing schemas names the concrete
   reasoning skeleton.
4. Reuse of a schema across domains normalizes terminology only; it is never
   enough to merge public task ids.
5. Record the union of meaningful families used by a task's supported query
   branches. Different families do not by themselves force a split when the
   reviewed outer objective, candidate type, answer binding, annotation roles,
   and visible scaffold remain stable.
