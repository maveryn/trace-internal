# `task_charts__combo_mark__dual_threshold_condition_count`

## Contract
1. Domain: `charts`
2. Scene id: `combo_mark`
3. Source implementation domain/scene: `charts/combo_mark`
4. Query ids: `primary_above_and_line_above`, `primary_above_and_line_below`, `primary_below_and_line_above`
5. Semantic query details are recorded in `query_id` and trace params.

## Implementation
1. Registered class: `trace.tasks.charts.combo_mark.dual_threshold_condition_count.ChartsComboDualThresholdConditionCountTask`
2. Prompt lookup domain/scene: `charts/combo_mark`
3. Generation is deterministic from `instance_seed`, explicit params, prompt bundle, renderer config, and code versions.
4. Answers and annotation are produced from the same metadata execution trace.

## Annotation Contract
1. Answer schema: `integer_count`.
2. Annotation schema: `segment_set`.
3. Annotation is a `segment_set`; each segment is two `[x, y]` pixel points formatted `[[x0, y0], [x1, y1]]` and connects the primary-series mark point to the overlaid line mark point for one matching category.
4. Annotation should mark the minimal visual witnesses required by the task, following the cross-domain annotation policy.
5. Renderer context such as legends, axes, decorative labels, titles, and distractor text is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.

## Program Contract

Program: `count(x_label where compare(value(primary,x_label), primary_threshold, primary_relation) and compare(value(line,x_label), line_threshold, line_relation)); output=integer_count; annotation=segment_set(matching_primary_line_marks); scene=combo_mark; scope=dual_threshold_condition_count`

Candidate set: the visible primary marks, secondary-line marks, and shared category labels inside the `dual_threshold_condition_count` objective scope.
Operands: prompt-bound labels, categories, series names, thresholds, intervals, references, and encoded chart values, plus the active query id's comparator, direction, target role, or extremum focus when present.
Operation: evaluate `count` over the candidate set using the filters, comparisons, aggregations, rankings, projections, or counterfactual edits named in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` is the `integer_count` value bound by `integer_count`.
Annotation witnesses: `segment_set` witnesses bound by `segment_set(matching_primary_line_marks)`. Annotation is a `segment_set`; each segment is two `[x, y]` pixel points formatted `[[x0, y0], [x1, y1]]` and connects the primary-series mark point to the overlaid line mark point for one matching category. Annotation should mark the minimal visual witnesses required by the task, following the cross-domain annotation policy. Renderer context such as legends, axes, decorative labels, titles, and distractor text is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.
Query ids: `primary_above_and_line_above`, `primary_above_and_line_below`, `primary_below_and_line_above`.

## Reasoning Operations

Families: `filtering`, `counting`, `comparison`, `logical_composition`
