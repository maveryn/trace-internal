# `task_charts__density_curve__density_at_x_extremum_label`

## Contract
1. Domain: `charts`
2. Scene id: `density_curve`
3. Source implementation domain/scene: `charts/density_curve`
4. Query ids: `highest_density_at_x_label`, `lowest_density_at_x_label`
5. Semantic query details are recorded in `query_id` and trace params.

## Implementation
1. Registered class: `trace.tasks.charts.density_curve.density_at_x_extremum_label.ChartsDistributionDensityCurveDensityAtXExtremumLabelTask`
2. Prompt lookup domain/scene: `charts/density_curve`
3. Generation is deterministic from `instance_seed`, explicit params, prompt bundle, renderer config, and code versions.
4. Answers and annotation are produced from the same metadata execution trace.

## Annotation Contract
1. Answer schema: `string_label`.
2. Annotation schema: `point`.
3. Annotation should mark the point where the answer curve intersects the marked x-value, not the legend label, title, axis text, or reference-line label.
4. Renderer context such as legends, axes, interval guides, titles, and distractor text is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.

## Program Contract

Program: `arg_extreme(curve_label, density(curve_label,x_ref), direction={highest,lowest}); output=string_label; annotation=point(answer_density_at_x); scene=density_curve; scope=density_at_x_extremum_label`

Candidate set: the visible density curves, shaded regions, and axis labels inside the `density_at_x_extremum_label` objective scope.
Operands: prompt-bound labels, categories, series names, thresholds, intervals, references, and encoded chart values, plus the active query id's comparator, direction, target role, or extremum focus when present.
Operation: evaluate `arg_extreme` over the candidate set using the filters, comparisons, aggregations, rankings, projections, or counterfactual edits named in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` is the `string_label` value bound by `string_label`.
Annotation witnesses: `point` witnesses bound by `point(answer_density_at_x)`. Annotation should mark the point where the answer curve intersects the marked x-value, not the legend label, title, axis text, or reference-line label. Renderer context such as legends, axes, interval guides, titles, and distractor text is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.
Query ids: `highest_density_at_x_label`, `lowest_density_at_x_label`.

## Reasoning Operations

Families: `ranking`

## Query Details

| Query id | Program signature | Answer schema | Annotation schema |
|---|---|---|---|
| `highest_density_at_x_label` | `selection.density_at_x_extremum_label` | `string_label` | `point` |
| `lowest_density_at_x_label` | `selection.density_at_x_extremum_label` | `string_label` | `point` |
