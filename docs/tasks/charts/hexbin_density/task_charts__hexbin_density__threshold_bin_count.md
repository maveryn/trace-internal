# `task_charts__hexbin_density__threshold_bin_count`

## Contract
1. Domain: `charts`
2. Scene id: `hexbin_density`
3. Source implementation scene: `charts/hexbin_density`
4. Query ids: `above_threshold_bin_count`, `below_threshold_bin_count`
5. Semantic query details are recorded in `query_id` and trace params.

## Implementation
1. Registered class: `trace.tasks.charts.hexbin_density.threshold_bin_count.ChartsHexbinDensityThresholdBinCountTask`
2. Prompt lookup domain/scene: `charts/hexbin_density`
3. Generation is deterministic from `instance_seed`, explicit params, prompt bundle, renderer config, and code versions.
4. Answers and annotation are produced from the same metadata execution trace.

## Annotation Contract
1. Answer schema: `integer_count`.
2. Annotation schema: `point_set`.
3. Annotation should mark the center point of every visible hex bin matching the discrete density-level threshold.
4. Renderer context such as axes, legends, titles, and background treatments is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.

## Program Contract

Program: `count(hex_bin where compare(density_level(hex_bin), threshold_level, relation={at_least,below})); output=integer_count; annotation=point_set(center(matching_bins)); scene=hexbin_density; scope=threshold_bin_count`

Candidate set: the visible hexagonal bins and density/value labels inside the `threshold_bin_count` objective scope.
Operands: prompt-bound labels, categories, series names, thresholds, intervals, references, and encoded chart values, plus the active query id's comparator, direction, target role, or extremum focus when present.
Operation: evaluate `count` over the candidate set using the filters, comparisons, aggregations, rankings, projections, or counterfactual edits named in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` is the `integer_count` value bound by `integer_count`.
Annotation witnesses: `point_set` witnesses bound by `point_set(center(matching_bins))`. Annotation should mark the center point of every visible hex bin matching the discrete density-level threshold. Renderer context such as axes, legends, titles, and background treatments is metadata unless the task explicitly asks for it as annotation.
Query ids: `above_threshold_bin_count`, `below_threshold_bin_count`.

## Query Details

| Query id | Program signature | Answer schema | Annotation schema |
|---|---|---|---|
| `above_threshold_bin_count` | `count.one_bound_threshold` | `integer_count` | `point_set` |
| `below_threshold_bin_count` | `count.one_bound_threshold` | `integer_count` | `point_set` |
