# `task_games__snakes_ladders__remaining_to_finish_value`

## Contract
1. Domain: `games`
2. Scene id: `snakes_ladders`
3. Public task id: `task_games__snakes_ladders__remaining_to_finish_value`
4. Supported `query_id` values: `single`
5. Answer schema: `integer`
6. Annotation schema: `bbox_map`
7. Program schema: `value(final_square - token_square); scene=snakes_ladders; scope=remaining_to_finish_value`
8. Scalar annotation checked: `true`

## Program Contract

Program: `value(final_square - token_square); scene=snakes_ladders; scope=remaining_to_finish_value`

Candidate set: the visible game board, pieces, tokens, cards, tiles, marked state, legal-move cues, result panels, and labeled options inside the `remaining_to_finish_value` objective scope.
Operands: visible scene state and prompt-bound operands named by `final_square`, `token_square`, `snakes_ladders`, `remaining_to_finish_value`.
Operation: evaluate `value` over the candidate set using the visible game state, rules, legal moves, comparisons, counts, simulations, or option-selection constraints encoded in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` uses the `integer` schema; generation binds a unique final answer.
Annotation witnesses: `annotation` uses the `bbox_map` schema; the prompt/annotation contract defines the minimal visual witnesses.
Query ids: `single`.

## Generation Notes
1. Use the numbered board only; do not roll dice or follow snakes/ladders.
2. Annotation is a bbox map with `token_square` and `finish_square` roles.
3. Prompt wording comes from `prompts/games/snakes_ladders/games_snakes_ladders_v1.json`.
