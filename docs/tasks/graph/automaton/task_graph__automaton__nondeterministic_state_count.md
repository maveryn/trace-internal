# `task_graph__automaton__nondeterministic_state_count`

## Identity
1. Domain: `graph`
1. Scene id: `automaton`
1. Source package: `automaton`
1. Task id: `task_graph__automaton__nondeterministic_state_count`
1. Query id: `single`

## Contract
The image shows a finite-state transition diagram with state labels, directed
transition arrows, visible transition labels, a start arrow, and optional
double-ring accepting states. The task asks how many states have
nondeterministic outgoing transitions.

A state counts as nondeterministic when either:

1. It has an outgoing epsilon transition, rendered with label `eps`.
1. It has two or more outgoing transitions with the same input label.

Missing outgoing transitions do not count as nondeterminism.

## Program Contract

Program: `count(filter(states, has_epsilon_outgoing(state) or has_duplicate_outgoing_symbol(state))); output=integer; annotation=point_set(nondeterministic_state_centers); scene=automaton; scope=nondeterministic_state_count`

Candidate set: the visible graph, tree, network, route, matrix, table, node, edge, label, weight, path, and option elements inside the `nondeterministic_state_count` objective scope.
Operands: visible scene state and prompt-bound operands named by `filter`, `states`, `has_epsilon_outgoing`, `state`, `has_duplicate_outgoing_symbol`, `nondeterministic_state_centers`, `automaton`, `nondeterministic_state_count`.
Operation: evaluate `count` over the candidate set using the visible graph structure, labels, weights, directions, reachability, paths, connectivity, or option-selection constraints encoded in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` uses the `integer` schema; generation binds a unique final answer.
Annotation witnesses: `annotation` uses the `point_set` schema; the prompt/annotation contract defines the minimal visual witnesses.
Query ids: `single`.

## Answer And Annotation
1. Answer type: `integer`.
1. Annotation type: `point_set`.
1. Annotation contains one pixel point at the center of each counted source
   state. For answer `0`, annotation is an empty point set.
1. Audit metadata also records the witness transition labels and their
   projected label boxes, but those boxes are not the verifier annotation.

## Sampling
1. State count: `4..6`.
1. Target answer support: `0..5`, capped by state count.
1. Nondeterminism is introduced only through `eps` transitions or duplicate
   outgoing labels.
1. Layout, transform, edge routing, node color, backgrounds, and post-image
   noise follow `configs/domains/graph/automaton.yaml` and graph-domain base defaults.
