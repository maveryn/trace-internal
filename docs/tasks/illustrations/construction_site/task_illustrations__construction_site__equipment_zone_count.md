# `task_illustrations__construction_site__equipment_zone_count`

## Summary
- Domain: `illustrations`
- Scene id: `construction_site`
- Implementation scene: `construction_site`
- Implementation source: `trace/tasks/illustrations/construction_site/equipment_zone_count.py`

## Contract
1. Domain: `illustrations`
2. Scene id: `construction_site`
3. Public task id: `task_illustrations__construction_site__equipment_zone_count`
4. Supported `query_id` values: `single`
5. Query ids: `single`
6. Answer schema: `integer_count`
7. Annotation schema: `bbox_set`
8. Program schema: `count(filter(construction_vehicles, zone(vehicle)=target_zone)); scene=construction_site; scope=equipment_zone_count`

## Program Contract

Program: `count(filter(construction_vehicles, zone(vehicle)=target_zone)); scene=construction_site; scope=equipment_zone_count`

Candidate set: the visible illustrated scene objects, people, regions, tiles, patches, labels, and option panels inside the `equipment_zone_count` objective scope.
Operands: visible scene state and prompt-bound operands named by `filter`, `construction_vehicles`, `zone`, `vehicle`, `target_zone`, `construction_site`, `equipment_zone_count`.
Operation: evaluate `count` over the candidate set using the visible illustrated objects, regions, layout relationships, counts, patch/tile transforms, or option-selection constraints encoded in the program expression; generation enforces a unique final answer.
Output binding: `answer` uses the `integer` schema; a non-negative integer derived from the same execution trace as the annotation.
Annotation witnesses: `annotation` uses the `bbox_set` schema; the prompt/annotation contract defines the minimal visual witnesses.
Query ids: `single`.

## Task Contract
Counts visible construction vehicles assigned to one named construction-zone scope.

## Query Branches

| Query id | Program schema |
| --- | --- |
| `single` | `count(filter(construction_vehicles, zone(vehicle)=target_zone)); scene=construction_site; scope=equipment_zone_count` |

## Program Metadata
- Program signatures: `count.scoped_attribute`
- Base program contract: `count(filter(construction_vehicles, zone(vehicle)=target_zone)); scene=construction_site; scope=equipment_zone_count`
- Parameter axes: `target_zone`
- Arguments:
  - `construction_vehicles`: semantic_role; allowed `visible_construction_vehicles`; source `program_schema_concrete`
  - `target_zone`: semantic_role; allowed `excavation_zone`, `loading_zone`, `roadwork_zone`; source `sampled_scene_value`
  - `vehicle`: semantic_role; allowed `construction_vehicle_instance`; source `program_schema_concrete`
- Argument metadata status: `curated`
- Supported query ids: `single`
- `target_zone` is sampled/overridden through task parameters and recorded in trace metadata; it is not a public query-id branch because the prompt resolves the concrete zone name before asking the same count operation.

## Answer Contract
- Answer schema: `integer_count`
- Generator `answer_gt.type`: `integer`
- Supported answer range: `0..4`
- The answer value is a non-negative integer derived from the same execution trace as the annotation.

## Annotation Contract
- Annotation schema: `bbox_set`
- Generator `annotation_gt.type`: `bbox_set`
- Annotation is an unordered set of final-image pixel points, one near the center of each counted construction vehicle. Do not include labels, numeric annotations, or context-only regions.
- When the answer is `0`, annotation is an empty bbox set.
- Annotation and answer must be projected from the same generated scene trace, not inferred from pixels or prompt text.

## Prompt And Trace Requirements
- Prompt text must come from the `illustrations_construction_site_v1` scene prompt bundle, with scene/task/output layers selected deterministically and recorded in metadata.
- Render randomness, sampled fonts/styles, query operands, and verifier payloads must be explicit in the instance trace.
- Distractor/context text may be rendered only when it is part of the scene grammar and must not be treated as annotation unless it is the queried visual witness.
