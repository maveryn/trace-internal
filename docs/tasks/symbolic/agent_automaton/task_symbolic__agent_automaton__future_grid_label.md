# `task_symbolic__agent_automaton__future_grid_label`

## Summary
1. Domain: `symbolic`
2. Scene: `agent_automaton`
3. Task id: `task_symbolic__agent_automaton__future_grid_label`
4. Goal: simulate a turning-agent automaton and choose the option showing the full grid after the requested number of updates.

## Program Contract
Program: `agent_automaton.future_grid(scene=agent_automaton, scope=source_grid_and_future_grid_options, rule_variant=binary_rule|three_state_rule, output=option_letter)`

Candidate set: the four visible future-grid option cards.
Operands: the source grid cell states, start arrow cell and direction, selected rule variant, and requested step count.
Operation: simulate the turning-agent rule for the requested number of updates and select the unique option whose full grid state matches the result.
Output binding: `answer` is the selected option letter.
Annotation witnesses: a `bbox_map` with `source_grid` and `selected_option` roles.
Query ids: `single`.

## Reasoning Operations

Families: `state_update`

## Contract
1. Query ids: `single`
2. Rule variant metadata: `binary_rule|three_state_rule`
3. Answer type: `option_letter`
4. Annotation schema: `bbox_map`
5. Annotation target: role-keyed bboxes for `source_grid` and `selected_option`
6. Scene variants: `clean_grid|lab_panel|notebook_grid`
7. Generation controls: board size `3..5` rows/cols, step count `3..6`, grid options `4`
8. Prompt bundle: `symbolic_agent_automaton_v1`
9. Source file: `trace/tasks/symbolic/agent_automaton/future_grid_label.py`

## Annotation Contract
The annotation is a `bbox_map` with two roles:

1. `source_grid`: bbox around the visible starting grid with the initial agent marker. The source panel is marked with `START`; the marker is not part of the source-grid annotation bbox.
2. `selected_option`: bbox around the correct future-grid option card.

The answer and annotation are bound from the same simulated execution trace.
