# `task_symbolic__dice__pair_difference_probability`

## Public Taxonomy
1. Domain: `symbolic`
2. Scene id: `dice`
3. Task id: `task_symbolic__dice__pair_difference_probability`
4. Objective: two-tray absolute-difference probability.

## Program Contract
Program: `dice.pair_difference_probability(scene=dice, scope=two_visible_trays, predicate=absolute_difference, output=reduced_fraction_string)`

Candidate set: the cartesian product of one die from tray `A` and one die from tray `B`.
Operands: each die's top-face value in both trays and the sampled absolute-difference target.
Operation: count ordered tray-pair outcomes whose absolute value difference equals the target and reduce `favorable / total_outcomes`.
Output binding: `answer` is the reduced fraction string.
Annotation schema: `bbox_map`.
Annotation witnesses: a `bbox_map` with `tray_a` and `tray_b` bboxes.
Query ids: `single`.

## Generation And Trace
1. The task asks for the probability that the absolute difference between the two selected visible values equals a sampled value.
2. The execution trace records tray specs, die colors, die values, favorable outcome counts, total outcome counts, and the reduced fraction answer.
3. Scene variants are `dice_tray_clean`, `dice_tray_felt`, and `dice_tray_notebook`; dice visual style is non-semantic rendering metadata.
4. Annotation is projected from finalized tray geometry, not from pixels.
5. Scalar annotation checked: true.

## Implementation
