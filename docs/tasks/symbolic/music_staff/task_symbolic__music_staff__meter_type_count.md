# `task_symbolic__music_staff__meter_type_count`

## 1) Identity
1. Domain: `symbolic`
2. Scene id: `music_staff`
3. Task id: `task_symbolic__music_staff__meter_type_count`
4. Objective contract: `meter_type_count`

## Program Contract
Program: `music_staff.meter_type_count(scene=music_staff, scope=four_measures_with_time_signatures, predicate=target_meter_type, output=integer)`

Candidate set: the four visible measure ranges with time signatures.
Operands: the visible time signature in each measure range and the requested meter type.
Operation: classify each time signature by meter type and count the ranges matching the requested type.
Output binding: `answer` is the matching range count as an integer.
Annotation witnesses: a homogeneous `bbox_set` of measure range boxes whose signature has the requested meter type.
Query ids: `single`.

## Reasoning Operations

Families: `filtering`, `counting`

## 2) Scene + task contract
1. Entities/relations: a rendered music-staff notation panel with marked notes, chords, measure ranges, option cards, or key signatures depending on the task objective.
2. Supported `query_id` values: `single`
3. `answer_gt.type`: `integer`
4. Default `annotation_gt.type`: `bbox_set`
5. Annotation schema: `bbox_set`
6. Annotation witness policy: annotation marks measure range boxes whose visible signature has the requested meter type; non-target notes, nonmatching ranges, staff lines, and decorative background are not prompt-facing annotation.

| Query id | User-facing operation |
|---|---|
| `single` | The prompt asks the one stable objective contract for this task. |

## 3) Prompt contract
1. `prompt_bundle_id`: `symbolic_music_staff_v1`
2. `scene_key`: `music_staff`
3. `task_key`: `music_meter_type_count`
4. Query keys: internal branch key from the generated trace; public single-operation tasks expose `query_id=single` after registry normalization.
5. Output modes: `answer_only`, `answer_and_annotation`

## 4) Determinism + constraints
1. Deterministic generation and rendering from `instance_seed`.
2. Answer and annotation are bound from the same finalized notation scene and projected bboxes.
3. Count tasks construct the requested answer count before rendering; label tasks construct a unique target label by scene state.
4. No semantic constraints are auto-relaxed after sampling.
