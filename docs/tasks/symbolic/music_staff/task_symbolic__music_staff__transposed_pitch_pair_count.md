# `task_symbolic__music_staff__transposed_pitch_pair_count`

## 1) Identity
1. Domain: `symbolic`
2. Scene id: `music_staff`
3. Task id: `task_symbolic__music_staff__transposed_pitch_pair_count`
4. Objective contract: `transposed_pitch_pair_count`

## Program Contract
Program: `music_staff.transposed_pitch_pair_count(scene=music_staff, scope=four_numbered_note_pairs, predicate=upward_interval_match, output=integer)`

Candidate set: the four visible numbered note-pair ranges.
Operands: the two notes in each pair and the requested upward interval predicate.
Operation: compute the upward interval for each note pair and count pairs matching the requested interval.
Output binding: `answer` is the matching pair count as an integer.
Annotation witnesses: a homogeneous `bbox_set` of numbered note-pair range boxes that satisfy the requested interval.
Query ids: `single`.

## 2) Scene + task contract
1. Entities/relations: a rendered music-staff notation panel with marked notes, chords, measure ranges, option cards, or key signatures depending on the task objective.
2. Supported `query_id` values: `single`
3. `answer_gt.type`: `integer`
4. Default `annotation_gt.type`: `bbox_set`
5. Annotation schema: `bbox_set`
6. Annotation witness policy: annotation marks numbered note-pair range boxes that satisfy the requested upward interval; non-target notes, nonmatching ranges, staff lines, and decorative background are not prompt-facing annotation.

| Query id | User-facing operation |
|---|---|
| `single` | The prompt asks the one stable objective contract for this task. |

## 3) Prompt contract
1. `prompt_bundle_id`: `symbolic_music_staff_v1`
2. `scene_key`: `music_staff`
3. `task_key`: `music_transposed_pitch_pair_count`
4. Query keys: internal branch key from the generated trace; public single-operation tasks expose `query_id=single` after registry normalization.
5. Output modes: `answer_only`, `answer_and_annotation`

## 4) Determinism + constraints
1. Deterministic generation and rendering from `instance_seed`.
2. Answer and annotation are bound from the same finalized notation scene and projected bboxes.
3. Count tasks construct the requested answer count before rendering; label tasks construct a unique target label by scene state.
4. No semantic constraints are auto-relaxed after sampling.
