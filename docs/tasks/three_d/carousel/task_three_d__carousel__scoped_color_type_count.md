## Summary
- Domain: `three_d`

- Answer type: `integer`
- Annotation type: unordered `bbox_set`
- Annotation schema: `bbox_set`

## Program Contract
- `count(filter(conveyor_objects, belt_key=target_belt_key, shape_type=target_shape_type, color_name=target_color_name)); scene=carousel; scope=scoped_color_type_count`

## Contract
The image shows one 3D airport-style conveyor carousel with two visible
concentric elliptical belts: an inner belt and an outer belt. Small 3D objects
sit on the belt surfaces. The prompt asks for the number of objects on one
requested belt that match both a canonical named color and one sampled object
type.

The answer is the integer count of finalized objects whose `belt_key`,
`shape_type`, and `color_name` all match the sampled target predicate. The
answer support is `0..5`. Color-readout generation avoids target-confusable
named color distractors, such as red with maroon or blue with cyan. Generation
includes partial-match distractors on the requested belt, including same-color
wrong-type objects and same-type wrong-color objects. Wrong-type distractors
avoid target-confusable object families such as card/envelope/book,
sphere/button, cup/bowl/tray, and lantern/candle. The other belt may contain
objects with the target color and target type, but those are outside the
requested scope and do not count. The carousel object pool excludes long thin
pen/ruler style objects that do not fit the belt grammar clearly.

## Annotation Contract
Annotation is a `bbox_set` containing one `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` pixel box around
each counted target object. Other objects, partial-match distractors, objects
on the other belt, belt surfaces, arrows, and decorative station context are
not annotation. If the answer is `0`, the annotation is an empty `bbox_set`.

## Prompt And Trace
The prompt bundle is `three_d_carousel_v1` under
`prompts/three_d/carousel/`. Named color prompts use the canonical
repo-wide color format, such as `blue [#2D75E6]`.

The trace records scene variant, belt records, target belt, target object type,
target color, object specs, projected object boxes and centers, camera,
projection frame, and solver count predicate.

## Determinism
Generation is deterministic from `instance_seed`, explicit params, config
defaults, prompt bundle, and code versions. Answers and annotation come from the
same finalized conveyor trace.
