- Supported `query_id`s: `type_and_not_color_count`, `color_and_not_type_count`
- Answer type: `integer`
- Annotation type: unordered `bbox_set`
- Annotation schema: `bbox_set`

## Program Contract
`count(filter(object_cluster_objects, positive_attribute = target_value and excluded_attribute != excluded_value)); scene=object_cluster; scope=multi_attribute_exclusion_count`

## Contract
The image shows many small synthetic perspective 3D colored objects arranged on a plain surface. The prompt asks for a count under one positive attribute while excluding a second attribute: either named type but not named color, or named color but not named type. Prompt-facing semantic colors include the canonical color hex label, for example `red [#E63232]`.

The answer is the integer count of finalized clustered objects satisfying the requested exclusion predicate. Generation includes structured excluded-overlap distractors, such as red cubes when the prompt asks for cubes that are not red. Generated color distractors avoid near-color named pairs such as blue/cyan/purple and red/maroon/magenta.

## Annotation Contract
Annotation is a `bbox_set` containing one `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` pixel box around each counted object satisfying the requested exclusion predicate. The annotation set is unordered because all witnesses have the same role and annotation cardinality matches the answer.

## Prompt And Trace
The prompt bundle is `three_d_object_cluster_v1` under `prompts/three_d/object_cluster/`. The trace records camera pose, projection frame, object world coordinates, sampled dimensions, prompt-facing object names, semantic colors, target type/color, target object ids, shape/color/property counts, projected object boxes, and the solver count predicate.

## Determinism
Generation is deterministic from `instance_seed`, explicit params, config defaults, prompt bundle, and code versions. Answers and annotation come from the same finalized 3D scene trace.
